"""Shared SQLAlchemy implementation of the authorization tables.

The sync SQLAlchemy backends (``PostgresDb``, ``SqliteDb``) expose authorization storage
as ``BaseDb`` methods (``*_authz_*``); both delegate to the functions here so the query
logic lives in one place instead of being duplicated per backend. Each function takes the
backend's ``Engine`` and the already-resolved ``Table`` (the backend fetches it via
``_get_table(..., create_table_if_not_found=True)`` so tables are created by the normal
schema-aware path on first use).

Two properties this layer must preserve, because the authorization model depends on them:

* **Fresh reads.** Nothing here caches. A revocation on one replica has to be enforced by
  every other replica on its next request, so each decision reads the tables. (The
  request-scoped memo in ``agno.os.authz`` sits above this and dies with the request.)
* **Atomic role replacement.** ``replace_subject_roles`` is one transaction. Done as
  read-then-delete-then-insert it leaves a window with no role at all, and lets two
  concurrent assigns each clear only what they saw and leave the subject holding both.
