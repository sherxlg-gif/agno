"""Managed users for AgentOS — a credential-less user directory.

This is the "no IdP" tier. When a customer has no external identity provider,
their app still authenticates users its own way and mints a JWT that AgentOS
verifies (see :class:`~agno.os.middleware.jwt.JWTValidator`). agno does NOT store
passwords and is NOT an authenticator — it owns a *directory* of the users the
app asserts, plus their roles (via :class:`~agno.os.authz.authorization.Authorization`) and enforcement.

What this store buys you over "roles only":
    - **Enumeration / management UX**: list the users that exist, not just react
      to whatever ``sub`` shows up in a token. Pick a user to assign a role.
    - **A real off-switch**: ``disabled`` is checked at the enforcement point, so
      a disabled user is denied *even with a still-valid token* — instant
      revocation you can't get from token expiry alone.
    - **Audit/identity enrichment**: map an opaque ``sub`` to an email/name in the
      decision and change trails.

It is deliberately small: a user is ``id`` (the JWT ``sub``), optional ``email``
/ ``name``, a ``disabled`` flag, timestamps, and free-form ``metadata``. No
credentials, ever.

Two ways users land in the directory:
    - **Explicit**: an admin creates them up front (``upsert``) and assigns roles.
    - **Just-in-time**: on the first valid token from an unknown subject, AgentOS
      can auto-provision a row from the token's claims (opt-in; see
      ``provision_from_claims`` and ``AuthorizationConfig``).

Backed by your own DB (pass ``db``/``db_url``); falls back to
in-memory when neither is given (fine for tests, not for production).

    A peer of :class:`~agno.os.authz.authorization.Authorization`, not a part of it. It stores no
    policy, only a roster of people with a ``disabled`` off switch (a revocation that outlives a
    valid token) and the settings for just-in-time provisioning from token claims. Identity is
    still asserted by the token; this never stores credentials. Pass it as
    ``AgentOS(user_directory=...)``:

        AgentOS(db=db, agents=[...], authorization=authz, user_directory=True)

    ``True`` builds the roster on the OS db with JIT provisioning on. Build it yourself to set the
    knobs, or to persist it somewhere other than the OS db (``db=`` / ``db_url=``); one built with
    neither is in memory until AgentOS lends it the OS db. It works with no authorization at all,
    as an advisory roster keyed off the run's user id; under authorization the off switch is
    enforced by the middleware and ``/users`` is mounted for admins.

    The roster itself is managed here: ``upsert``, ``get``, ``list``, ``set_disabled``, ``remove``
    (and their async twins). Audit is owned by ``Authorization``: at wiring, AgentOS hands this
    directory the ``Authorization(audit=...)`` sink, so every directory change (``user.created``,
    ``user.disabled``, ...) lands in the same change trail as role changes.
