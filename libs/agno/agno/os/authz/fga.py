"""Fine-grained / relationship-based authorization (ReBAC) for AgentOS.

RBAC answers "what may a *role* do?"; FGA answers "what may *this user* do on
*this specific object*, given the relationships between them?" — e.g. "alice may
run workflow-7 because she owns the folder it lives in." That's the model behind
Zanzibar, OpenFGA, and WorkOS FGA.

AgentOS doesn't embed an FGA engine — relationship evaluation belongs in a
purpose-built store (OpenFGA, a WorkOS FGA tenant, SpiceDB, ...). Instead this
plugs any such store into the existing :class:`AuthorizationProvider` seam:

    AuthorizationContext            FGA query
    ─────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────────────────────
    principal_id  = "alice"     →   user     = "user:alice"
    action        = "run"       →   relation = "run"
    resource_type = "workflows"     object   = "workflows:workflow-7"
    resource_id   = "workflow-7"

So a per-resource check becomes one FGA ``Check`` call, and list-filtering becomes
one ``ListObjects`` call — the two primitives every FGA engine has.

Bring your own backend by implementing the tiny :class:`FGAClient` port (two
methods). :class:`OpenFGAClient` is a batteries-included adapter for OpenFGA
(``pip install "agno[fga]"``); the same provider works against WorkOS FGA or any
other engine by writing an equally small client.

Typical wiring composes FGA (per-resource ReBAC) with the scope provider (coarse
route gating), since FGA has no notion of non-resource routes like ``/config``::

    Authorization(verification_keys=KEYS, audience=OS_ID, authorization_provider=[
        ScopeAuthorizationProvider(),          # gates /config, /sessions, ... by scope
        FGAAuthorizationProvider(fga_client),  # per-resource agents/teams/workflows by relationship
    ])

    It governs the per-resource families (agents/teams/workflows) relationally.
    Routes it can't express as a single object (``/config``, ``/sessions``, the
    scope-gated routes) it ABSTAINS on — so pair it with a scope provider via the
    list form of ``authorization_provider`` (see the module docstring).

    NOTE — ``admin_scope`` does not apply here. The ``agent_os:admin`` bypass is a
    scope-plane feature (``ScopeAuthorizationProvider`` reads it off the token's
    scopes); this provider decides purely on relationships, so a token carrying
    ``agent_os:admin`` gets NO bypass from it and must instead hold an admin
    RELATIONSHIP in the engine. That is the intended ReBAC behaviour, but it means a
    standalone FGA deployment has no token-scope admins at all. Running it alongside
    a scope provider (the recommended pairing above) restores the bypass, since the
    composition is an OR.
